					<p>
					I've always loved working with computers. When I was a kid, I loved watching my father open up his PC and troubleshoot issues. All the connections, fans, boards, and electronics were fascinating to me. When I was 7 years old, my mom bought me a GameBoy Color with Pokemon Yellow Version. It wasn't the first video game I had ever played, but it was mine and mine alone and I cherished it. Till this day, playing video games is my passion. I love competitive MMORPGs, the complexity and depth in these games is what draws me, and the PvP competitive aspect is what hooks me.
					<br><br>
					My dream career is to be a game developer, and have the chance to work on and improve the next huge MMORPG. This dream is what drives me to learn full stack web development. I already have experience with C++ and Java, which most game development API's use as their base programming languages, and I'm in the process of learning python as well. Once I've learned how a game is made on the front-end, how it connects to a database, and how the database universe is built, I'll be adequately prepared to join a game development team and live my dream.
